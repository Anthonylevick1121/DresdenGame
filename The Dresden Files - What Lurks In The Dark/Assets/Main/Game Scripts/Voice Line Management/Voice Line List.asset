  - you shouldn't see this lol
  - "Hello Michael, it\u2019s me calling to talk to you about your prescription.
    Make sure to take one every night before bed. And if you have any other questions,
    make sure to call and let me know. Please be discrete about this. Remember it
    gets worse before it gets better."

  - "\u201CHello? Hello? Finally I got through to you! I don\u2019t have much time
    to explain. You need to find some way to wake up and leave the dream, don\u2019t
    trust him - he\u2019s lying to you.\u201D Who was that? Leave the\u2026 dream?
    Have all these events just been dreams? If this is a dream, then even that call
    was part of it. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just bad side effects or something
    else. "
  - She looks so happy here. I wish she was still here.
  - I remember when this paper arrived at my doorstep. Right there on the front page.
    She was well loved in the community.
  - A man came up to me a couple weeks after the funeral offering help. I took him
    up on his offer.
  - This was her necklace, I remember when we got this.
  - "It\u2019s just a nightmare. It has to be! It can\u2019t be real. It just can\u2019t."
  - "I couldn\u2019t bring myself to get rid of these just yet\u2026 but I also can\u2019t
    bring myself to read them."
  - "\u201CHere\u2019s my card. Take some time to\u2026 think it over.\u201D He scribbled
    his information down for me here saying it was his \u201Ccard\u201D. I wonder
    how much of a professional he truly is. "
  - "Doctors said they found nothing wrong with me, yet this man said he could help
    me. I\u2019m not sure who to believe."
  - "I miss her. There\u2019s not a day that goes by where I don\u2019t think of
    you."
  - "Well, no ill effects so far, although I\u2019m not too sure how long it will
    take for these to kick in."
  - "This isn\u2019t working at all. My dreams just keep getting weirder."
  - This should hopefully help with the weird electricity issues this place seemingly
    has.
  - "I haven\u2019t set foot in this room since\u2026 nevermind. I don\u2019t know
    how or why this alarm was set."
  - I remember making breakfast with her in the mornings before leaving to go to
    work. For now, eating this will suffice.
  - I put many of the gifts she gave me in here. What do I do with them now? All
    they do is remind me of her.
  - "This clock was telling the right time yesterday. It\u2019s off by 3 hours now.
    What happened to it?"
  - Doing laundry is not my favorite thing to do in the morning, but it has to be
    done I suppose.
  - "These nightmares\u2026 they\u2019re beginning to haunt me more and more. They
    feel so real. Maybe I\u2019ll call and ask if this is all just a side effect."
  - "I don\u2019t know who was on the phone, but I feel like I have to trust them.
    I need to run\u2026 fast."
